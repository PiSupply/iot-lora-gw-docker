#This program will check if it can ping the server below for internet connectivity
#On each interface one by one and change the priority accordingly.

#Gateways can be configured with 3 methods, The onboard ethernet, Wi-Fi & LTE.
#Priority should be Ethernetm Then Wi-FI (if detected) then LTE.
#We don't need to ping via LTE as if the other connections are not up then even
#if LTE is down then it won't matter.
